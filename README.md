Composer plugin that allows to download a specified artifact instead of the default `dist` URL, this allows
to download all artifact dependencies too.

## Installation

The recommended way of installing the plugin is via [Composer][2].

```bash
composer require openeuropa/composer-artifacts
```

## Usage

Edit the composer.json file and add the following in your `extra` section:

```json
{
    "extra": {
        "artifacts": {
            "foo/bar": {
              "dist": {
                "url": "https://github.com/{name}/releases/download/{pretty-version}/{project-name}-{version}.tar.gz",
                "type": "tar"
              }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This will fetch `dist` content from:

```
https://github.com/foo/bar/releases/download/0.1.0/bar-0.1.0.tar.gz"
```

Valid `type` values are `tar` and `zip` while available URL replacement tokens are:

- `{name}`: the full package's name without version info, e.g. `foo/bar`
- `{vendor-name}`: just the vendor name, e.g. `foo`
- `{project-name}`: just the project name, e.g. `bar`
- `{pretty-version}`: the pretty (i.e. non-normalized) version string of this package, e.g. `0.1.0`
- `{version}`: the full version of this package, e.g. `0.1.0.0`
- `{stability}`: the stability of this package, e.g. `dev`, `alpha`, `beta`, `RC` or `stable`
- `{type}`: the package type, e.g. `library`
- `{checksum}`: the SHA1 checksum for the distribution archive of this version

## Development setup

### Using Docker Compose

Alternatively, you can build a development environment using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker) and 
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) with the provided configuration.

Docker provides the necessary services and tools needed to get the tests running, 
regardless of your local host configuration.

#### Requirements:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

#### Configuration

By default, Docker Compose reads two files, a `docker-compose.yml` and an optional `docker-compose.override.yml` file.
By convention, the `docker-compose.yml` contains your base configuration and it's provided by default.
The override file, as its name implies, can contain configuration overrides for existing services or entirely new 
services.
If a service is defined in both files, Docker Compose merges the configurations.

Find more information on Docker Compose extension mechanism on [the official Docker Compose documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/).

#### Usage

To start, run:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

It's advised to not daemonize `docker-compose` so you can turn it off (`CTRL+C`) quickly when you're done working.
However, if you'd like to daemonize it, you have to add the flag `-d`:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Then:

```bash
docker-compose exec web composer install
```

#### Running the tests

To run the grumphp checks:

```bash
docker-compose exec web ./vendor/bin/grumphp run
```

To run the phpunit tests:

```bash
docker-compose exec web ./vendor/bin/phpunit
```
